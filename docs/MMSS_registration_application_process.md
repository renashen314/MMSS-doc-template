# MMSS Registration Application Process

The MMSS registration opens at the end of December every year and lasts through June. The link to the MMSS Registration application will be included in all advertising materials sent to potential or returning applicants ([https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mmss/](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mmss/)).

## Sign Up Process
