![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2yanA-4eGwB4YQEm0HqnYgO9bGujRfz3rPuF1I5vzNRws8MF8GHSp9nQKfx5zxbL7TOMxqc6D0_QvrL5wav0ll_Vh9bvTTss1gCVeYOfjW1-X53cMCZPy6Kmq53k1dSMpZaDZfx4m-SHlDVEyLhvgD4)

- **Edit Application:** This action is where MMSS Administrators can assign both the session and the course for the accepted MMSS Applicant.
- **Delete Application:** Remove application no matter the status.
- **Place on Waitlist:** Place the MMSS Applicant in a waitlist for a particular camp due to capacity.
- **Reject Applicant:** Decline the MMSS Applicants but the application remains on the Index.

To assign a session(s) and a course(s):
